## CSC493: R08: The About Section<sup>1</sup>

## Overview

You have two main tasks for this week:
- Draft an about statement and embed it in the <code>README.md file</code>
- Complete a new software component, which can again be small.

You should always be improving your documents as more details become apparent.

*DO NOT TAKE THIS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SLACK OFF.* 

## About section

Add biographical information to your <code>README.md</code> file under the author's name. In many
software releases, you will find an “About the Team” section. This section includes brief biographical
information is offered about each team member. This biographical information is almost always written
in the third person, though it can still be very personal and can give insight into the person’s personality
and character.

See examples at:
  - [https://www.coffeecup.com/about/](https://www.coffeecup.com/about/)
  - [https://www.khanacademy.org/about/the-team](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/the-team)

For this week, you can include an avatar of yourself and instead of calling it "About the Tean", you can 
call yourself something like "Lead Developer" because you are working by yourself.

## More Software development

As mentioned before, all agile design methodologies recommend breaking systems down into small units that you 
build incrementally but consistently.

Fully implement another small portion(s) of your project and ensure that you follow good practices, such as meaningful
function and variable names and extensive informative comments.

Be sure to identify which component you have fully implemented in your weekly report.

## Documentation

As a weekly practice, you should be improving the various documents you created already, such as <code>requirements.md</code> and <code>design.md</code>.
