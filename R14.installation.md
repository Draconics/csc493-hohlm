# CSC 493: R14: Installation and Use<sup>1</sup>

## Overview
You should be finishing up the main implementation details of your project. Some of you will have clear installation instructions in order to be able to run your 
project, and others will have specific ideas of how to get your mobile app onto the phone.

## Documentation

You have some tasks to complete before next time:
- Create a installation document in a file called <code>installation.md</code>.
- Update <code>README.md</code> to link to the file you just created.
- Continue implementing pieces of your project (this assignment will be accompanied by another one on how to create issues on GitHub and linked them to commits and pulls.

<code>installation.md</code>
Write a guide that steps a typical user through how to install your software. In your final video, you will be demoing the installation,
so here do not use a video. Instead, show the installation in a typical case in writing. Screen shots are likely to be very useful here.

Next, detail in writing a few of the typical use cases of your software. Screen shots are likely to be helpful here too. Be sure to 
highlight the features that work well rather on dwelling on features that you wish you had time to implement in this prototype.

<code>README.md</code>

You should update the <code>README.md</code> file with a link to your Test Plan.

Fully implement another small portion(s) of your project. As always, it is required that you thoroughly comment this component
