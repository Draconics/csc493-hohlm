## CSC493: R07: Logo<sup>1</sup>

## Overview
You have been thinking about your project for a while now, so it is time to be a little creative and have some fun. 
Time to think if your LOGO! At the same time, you should be implementing small pieces of the CORE component of your 
system.

### Logos
How to choose a product logo?
- Read [Ten Tips for Choosing a Logo](https://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/logo_tips.htm)
- Read [How to design a logo: the ultimate guide](https://99designs.com/blog/logo-branding/how-to-design-logo/)
- Make your logo and commit it to Github. Be sure you do NOT violate copyright law in making your logo.
- Embed this logo in your README.md using a relative link that is begun with an exclamation mark. 
See the image section on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Update <code>README.md</code>

Open the <code>README.md</code> and insert an entry called "Product Logo" that is an image. You should be able to copy and paste the image directly into
the file, but if you are having issues, you can make it an internal link to open an image that is in your repo locally.

<code>README.md</code>

### Implementation Updates

As mentioned last time, all agile design methodologies recommend breaking systems down into small units so that 
you can start to test out and implement them.

A good idea is to create a directory called <code>code</code> or something like that if one does not exist already to place your pieces. 
Fully implement another small portion(s) of your project. As always, it is required that this component has internal 
documentation using comment lines. 
Create an issue for anything that you have implemented so that the TA or the instructor is able to give you targetted feedback.
Push your repo so that it is up to date.

Be sure to identify which component you have fully implemented in your weekly report and explain how it fits in with your system.
