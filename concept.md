# Project Proposal
## *Draconian Worldbuilder*
## [Readme](README.md)

## Goals:
The goal of this project is to aid in the development of fantasy worlds.

## Context:
Keeping notes for worldbuilding can quickly become unwieldy using standard tools such as microsoft word. As such, there is a certain type of software that keeps everything organized, even as the world gets larger and larger.
Primary examples include [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/) and [Campfire](https://www.campfirewriting.com/). These are both website based version, which make for easy sharing of notes. These also require servers, which take money to maintain. [Fantasia Archive](https://fantasiaarchive.com/) by contrast, is an offline one, that is completely free

## Novelty:
The primary thing that will seperate my project from similar ones is the economic tools I intend to provide.  I will give example markets that can be tweaked for scarcity and translated into different currency systems; including USD, which will be kept up to date with internet inflation data.

## Functionality:
The most import things is word processing, and a file storage system.  This specifically needs a way to hyperlink documents together for easy referencing; and my economic tools outlined below.

## Audience:
My intended audience is fantasy authors and RPG game masters.  The purpose of this project is to give them tools to aid in the development of their worlds, in which their stories will be told.

## Challenges:
The challenges that you anticipate encountering during this projectâ€™s development

## Measures:
Once the hyperlinks get working and I have a basic word processor; I will have created the bare minimums.

## Motivation:
Worldbuilding is a fun pastime, and the economic aspect particularly is particularly intriguing.

## Future Extensions:
One possible extension is the setting of custom tooltips on my hyperlinks. Hover over the hyperlink, and it shows a short summary of the page to jog your memory without having to click it
