# *Draconian Worldbuilder*
## Description/Motivation

This will be a worldbuilding software for fantasy authors.  The primary use of such a software is to allow authors to keep efficient notes as they write their stories, and build the world that contains them. As such; it will need a word processor, a file storage system, and the ability to link pages via hyperlink. I also intend to include a focus on the economic aspect of worldbuilding.  To support that, I will implement a few tables with currency converters using multiple different currency systems (such as English Â£sd and D&D's GP); with an API to keep it updated. 

### Prerequisites

This application will most likely run natively on windows machines.
