# *Draconian Worldbuilder*
## [Project Concept](concept.md)

## Scope

Primary features I need are world processing, file storage, and the ability to link pages to gether. Secondary features I need, is a modifiable table of prices for a basic economic market; with multiplers on various things to adjust it (For example: adjusting all weapons as the price of metal increases; due to a mine collapse). This table should allow for easy converting modern day USD, and a set of sample currencies (Such as English Â£sd).
