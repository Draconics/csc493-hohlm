# CSC 493: R02: Project Scope<sup>1</sup>

## Overview
In your first week you worked on a Project Concept Proposal and <code>README.md</code> files, both are living documents you will continue to edit as you make progress on your project. This week you will add two sections to your <code>README.md</code> file, Vision and Scope. You will also create a file called <code>requirements.md</code> where you will have your Preliminary Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

## Scope and Vision
We have a very constrained time-frame in this course to complete a sizable project. This means that scaling the scope of your project is very important. In English, the word “scope” means the range, size, or extent of something. In software development, one creates a Vision and Scope Document  to clearly specify what the software developers understand to be their tasks. Scope and vision are tied very close together -- an overly ambitious vision may results in too many features to end up out of scope.
"Out of scope” tasks are what the software developers assume are NOT their responsibility but for future development. In the business world, clarifying the scope and limitations helps to establish realistic expectations of the stakeholders and provides a reference frame against which proposed features and requirements changes can be evaluated. For this class, you should think very carefully about what you considered “out of scope”. You want to be ambitious and make something that you are proud to show off with as many cool features as possible but be realistic about your capabilities. 

We will use the Agile development model of software development to help with adjusting to what you determine as part of your scope and as such, scope is also a **living document** that we will only change when absolutely necessary. We start with a core component of your system (a proof of concept) you build first and early in the semester. You will then follow a cycle where you 

- pick and build a new small component 
- test the component in isolation with expected inputs and outputs (unit testing)
- integrating the component into your system
- test the new system
- maybe adjusting design and scope
- go back to step 1

Note that it would be advisable to implement and test as many components as possible between weekly report outs so that you can gauge your progress. You can also expect to encounter errors as you develop your system, and as long as you have a working (not necessarily perfect) system, you are making progress. You are to create **issues** in GitHub for things that you mean to fix and they can be a mix of bugs in your implementation and more aesthetic problems (the button on a web page is the wrong colour, and so forth). As long as you feel as though you are progressing with the **functionality**  of your system, the scope should not change. 

## Where to insert your Scope and Vision
In your <code>README.md</code> file, add the scope and vision paragraphs below the project concept section. 

<code>README.md</code>
- Project name
- Project Concept (linked to <code>concept.md</code>)
- **[Scope]**: This section should also be no more than one paragraph. It should very clearly specify both the scope of the project as what will be considered “out of scope”. Be sure to describe the intended major features that will be included in the project. Also, identify any product features or characteristics that a stakeholder might anticipate, but which are not planned to be included in the project.
- **[Vision]**:This section is no more than a paragraph. It should present a concise vision statement which summarizes the purpose and intent of the project and describes what the world will be like when the project is completed. This vision statement may be somewhat idealistic, but it still should be grounded in the realities of time and resource limitations.
- Prerequisites
- Built With
- Author name
- Acknowledgments

# Preliminary Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)

Once you have defined your vision and scope a bit more, now we go into more details about WHAT is needed.

## What is an SRS document?
A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a written understanding of system requirements prior to any actual design or implementation work. The SRS document states in precise and explicit language those functions and capabilities a software system must provide, and any required constraints which the system must follow. An SRS contains functional and nonfunctional requirements only, rather than design ideas. 

### Functional requirements 
Describe the functionality or capability that the software is to have.
#### Example: "Software must update and remember the highest score earned by all users."

### Non-functional requirements 
Qualities or constraints that the software must have or comply with, but which are not operations that will be automated.
#### Example: "Software must run on Windows XP".

Requirements are typically prioritized on as well as numbered so that they can be tracked as the project moves forward.

## Creating your SRS
Create a new file called <code>requirements.md</code> in your repository. Using your stated Scope as a guide, precisely and explicitly describe the primary software requirements using the following template for each specific requirement:

- Number: (List unique requirement number.)
- Statement: (Precisely state the requirement.)
- Evaluation Method: (How can you tell if the completed software satisfies this requirement?)
- Dependency: (List each other requirement on which satisfaction of this requirement depends or write "None")
- Priority: (Assign a priority to this requirement: essential, high, middle, low, or if time permits.)
- Requirement revision history: (when, what, and why)

Be sure that you list each requirement separately rather than combining two or more.
# To Submit
See Awesome READMEs for a list of great README files. In addition to creating the <code>requirements.md</code> file, update <code>README.md</code> as necessary.
