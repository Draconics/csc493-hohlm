# CSC 493: Final Documentation and Video

Be sure that your documentation is up to date and has all of the components listed below. Also, you will create a short 5-8 minute video to 
complement the poster session as described below:

## Final Documentation

You should update the <code>README.md</code> and ALL the files that it references (such as <code>requirements.md</code>, and so forth), by fixing 
any typos errors or with corrections as to what your final project is about. This is the **FINAL** version that you will ultimately be graded on.

## Video
- This [set of video demos](http://cs.berea.edu/courses/csc493-older/schedule.html) is older now, but most of the videos still exist. Watch some of them to get ideas and think about what you think is effective and what is not.
- Read [12 tips for killer software demos](https://www.cio.com/article/3074817/12-tips-for-killer-software-demos.html) and reflect on how to make a great video demo that really showcases the best parts of your prototype.

## Video Details
- Your video is to be a record of what you may say during poster session.
- It is fine for you to record your video(s) with a cell phone or with the free Zoom app. It is best if you **stabilize the recording device** by using a tripod or by putting your recording device on a table leaning on something. Do not have a friend hold it because it will be shaky.
- All videos must be **posted publicly to YouTube** and the auto-generated transcripts must be corrected. The video will be copied and reposted by the department unless you have a compelling reason that it should not be publicly posted or reposted and you successfully formally protest to the department about public posting or reposting.
- It would be a good idea to have a transcript before making the video. See [How To Make A Video About How To Make A Video About How To Make A
Video About How To Make a Video...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZ5rsAHMl4 ) to see what an internationally known video blogger has to say on this topic. For reasons of accessibility, you are be required to **correct the auto-generated YouTube transcript**.
- **Credits must be given** on each video in a professional way. These credits should include your name as well as acknowledgement of Berea College and any thanks you wish to give to anyone. Be sure to include all IDEs, libraries or APIs you used.
- Edit your videos to make it smooth. If you filmed about 8 minutes, you can edit it to be more professional. In Windows, the "Pictures" app works pretty well.
- Each video must have an **informative YouTube title** which indicates the actual software project topic. You can still have fun with the title, it just need to explain the software.
- Each video must have a **title screen** with the title, which also should indicate the actual topic of your project.
- The vast majority of your video(s) should be your amazing video content.
- All music in each video must be original or open source with credits given. I take this seriously, so steer **clear of using proprietary music**! There is a good amount of open source music out there-just search for it if you want to use music.
- Please note that each video is your intellectual property, which means you can use it later and link to it from your LinkedIn page and/or website.

## Required Video Content
- Briefly describe how the project **meets the goals** you set. (If you need to reduce the goals, you need to do so in the documentation!)
- Address the following questions, bearing in mind that you might need to practice in order to answer them without being stiff.
  - Discuss the **motivation** for your software and why it is important to you and to the larger society.
  - Describe the **single most important non-technical thing you learned** during your work on this project and why it is important.
  - Describe the **three most important technical things you learned** during your work on this project as though it was asked by an experienced student who has completed Data Structures.
  - Describe what you **learn about yourself** as you worked on this project.
  - Describe what you are the **most proud of** about this project.
